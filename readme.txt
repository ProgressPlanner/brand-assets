**Download Links Feature:**

The Brand Assets plugin includes a convenient feature for creating download links. When you add the `ba-download` class to a list item in Gutenberg, all links within that list item will automatically get the `download` attribute added to them.

**How to Use Download Links:**

1. **Create a List**: In the WordPress editor, create a list (ordered or unordered)
2. **Add the Class**: Select a list item and add the CSS class `ba-download` in the Advanced settings
3. **Add Links**: Add your download links within that list item
4. **Automatic Processing**: The plugin will automatically add the `download` attribute to all links in that list item

**Example:**

```
<ul>
  <li class="ba-download">
    <a href="https://example.com/files/brand-guidelines.pdf">Brand Guidelines (PDF)</a>
  </li>
  <li class="ba-download">
    <a href="https://example.com/files/logo-pack.zip">Logo Pack (ZIP)</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

The plugin will automatically transform these links to include the `download` attribute, making them trigger downloads instead of navigation. This feature is particularly useful for brand asset pages where you want to provide downloadable files like logos, brand guidelines, or other resources.
